# 🚀 ContribChain – Decentralized Group Contribution Tracker

> Fair grading. Transparent teamwork. Powered by Algorand Blockchain.

ContribChain is a decentralized platform that tracks **individual contributions in group projects** using immutable blockchain records.  
It eliminates freeloading, disputes, and biased grading by providing verifiable proof of work.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In academic and professional group projects:

- Some members contribute more than others  
- Grading is often subjective  
- Contribution proofs can be manipulated  
- Disputes arise at evaluation time  

**There is no trusted, tamper-proof system to track real effort.**
